# Practice programs

I've created a very basic programs in python that beginners can use. Feel free to download and use the code.

## Typing Game

This program generates a random pattern of letters and the player has to type it exactly as it is. The player can play as long as they want. When they want to end the game, they have to type "end." The program will give the number of patterns typed and the time played.

## Calculator

This program is a very basic calculator. The functions include basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The user enters two numbers and the operation they want to perform. The program returns the result of the operation.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

This program is a simple game. The user chooses a play, while the computer generates its own. Then, using various functions, a winner is chosen.
